# Data Engineer Project

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create your own baseball card, minus the graphic design part. Using the MLB Stats API and any other publicly available information, your task is to retrieve any information required for your card and organize it in an intuitive fashion. 

The information you include is up to you, i.e. you can choose to include the statistics you think are most relevant, use a traditional card as your model, or anything in between. Please provide a description of what you decided to include and why in your write up.

## Requirements

- The code can be written in the language of your choice, but it should be working. An incomplete, runnable project is better than code that will not run.
- The code can be designed for one player, but please be prepared to outline the changes that would be required to make it flexible to other players.
- The code should not only make API calls, but also transform the data into how it would look on the card (remove unnecessary fields, perform any transformations, join data sources, etc.).
    - The output file format is up to you (CSV, JSON, etc.).
    
## Resources

- MLB Stats API OpenAPI Specification
    - I recommend downloading Postman and importing the json file to view it.

## Deliverables
- Code used to retrieve information
- Write-up of methodology
- Sample data for 1+ players
- (Optional) Diagram with layout of baseball card


## Evaluation Criteria

The goal of this project is evaluate not only your technical skills, but also your ability to think critically and make decisions based on your technical and baseball knowledge. Creativity is encouraged. There is no right or wrong answer for what information you choose to include in your project, as long as the code quality is there and it is well-reasoned. 

If you have any questions or any part of the instructions are unclear, please do not hesitate to reach out to bplexico@raysbaseball.com.
